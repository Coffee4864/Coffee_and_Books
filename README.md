## Description

<div id="Describe">
Coffee and Books is a project that organizes the user's PDF documents and arranges them into "shelves," also allowing the user to view their books and shelves on mobile and desktop devices through the React frontend web interface, which will be available on port 9000 by default on the hosted server.

## Structure

<div id="Structure">

The system is divided into two folders, frontend and backend. The frontend is developed in React with Vite, while the backend API uses pure Node.js with a MySQL database. Both servers will communicate via JSON. The React frontend will run on port 9000 by default, and the backend on port 3001.
